Graph normalization
=================================
**BisPy** takes in input graphs having nodes whose labels are integers
starting from 0 and form an interval (no "holes" allowed). We refer to these
graphs with the name *integer graphs*. The submodule
:mod:`~bispy.utilities.graph_normalization` helps enforcing this rule on
graphs which are not integer.
